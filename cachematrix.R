## Rfunction that is able to cache potentially time-consuming matrix computations.
## This set functions is for creating a special "matrix" that can than be used to
## compute the inverse and cache the answer. This amkes retreving the answer less 
## time consuming.

## The first function, `makeCacheMatrix` creates a special "matrix", which can
##1.  set the value of the matrix
##2.  get the value of the matrix
##3.  set the value of the inverse
##4.  get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setInverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
        getInverse <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setInverse = setInverse,
             getInverse = getInverse)

}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix"
## created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the
## inverse has already been calculated. If so, it `get`s the inverse from the
## cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of
## the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the `setInverse`
## function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getInverse()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setInverse(m)
        m
}
